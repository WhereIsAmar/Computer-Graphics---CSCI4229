---- HOW TO COMPILE ----
 Via the Terminal

1)make clean
2)make

then run the corresponding object file hw6.o

3)./hw6


-------------  m          Switch the Perspective Mode (Perspective or Orthogonal or First Person)

-------------  +/-          Controls our field of view

-------------  Arrow Keys    Move around the scene and chaging angles as you go
-------------- G,V,B,N keys  When in first person will allow one to move around
-------------  i/j          Increase or Decrease the Dim
-------------  0            Reset overall view, will clear the view matrix
-------------  ESC          Leave the program
-------------- X            Will display the axes

Light Controls
-------------- a/A - decrease & increase ambient light
-------------- d/D - decrease & increase diffusion light
-------------- s/S - decrease & increase specular light
-------------- e/E - decrease & increase emitted light
-------------- n/N - decrease & increase shininess
-------------- k/K - decrease & increase the elevation of the light
-------------- < > move the light once q is pressed


Toggling Light:
-------------- q Pause the light and then be able to move it
-------------- l Enable and disable light
