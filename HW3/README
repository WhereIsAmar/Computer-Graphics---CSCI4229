This 3-D is not necessarily how a traditional home would be modeled today.
However, I thought it would be interesting to manipulate the traditional version of a roof. I added two structural supports to raise the roof as can be seen from my scene.

I aim to add more details in the future and create a more intriguing scene.

I have a generic instance of a cube and additional cubes are constructed with GL_QUAD primitives. I just call the buildingFrame() function with the different dimensions and colors. This results in each of the houses buildings for my scene.



It took about 7 hours to learn how start connecting the vertices and understand the concepts.



---- HOW TO COMPILE ----
 Via the Terminal

1)make clean
2)make

then run the corresponding object file HW3_patel.o

3)./HW3_patel

Some useful key bindings:
 m          	Switch the Perspective Mode (Perspective or Orthogonal)

 +/-          	Controls our field of view

 Arrow Keys    	Move around the scene and chaging angles as you go
 i/d        	Increase or Decrease the zoom perspective
 0          	Reset view
 ESC        	Leave the program
