1. If its not a direct path.
2. Role of position error
3. Role of the heading error not weighted as heavily until the end.
4. Bearing error 
	If the destination is the opposite direction of your heading (where you started). Because heading alone cannot take us to the correct location. 


	A plane would have to be facing the direction its going to land to be properly.

		errors -> speed -> odometry
		Make sure were facing the right direction
		That it continues to head towards the final destination

The feedback controller has been implemented

5. We used the equations 3.6.1 - 3.64 from page 64. Coupled with the built in constants
to adjust the wheel speed.
6. Calibration issue. 
7. Plug in the actual values into the equation. Jon will email us...
8.	Gain constants, p1, p2, p3 -> If altered
9.	Its only going to either be really straight or just focused on turns.
10. We have no implementation it will just push against the object...
11. See the object go like to a new coordinate. Under a stack when you reach the next coordinate you can just restart the calls to the proportional feedback controller.
12. Set the coordinate to extend to an extended x position. Keep the same y. Just extend past the obstacle.
13. Team alpha.
14. 9 hours.
