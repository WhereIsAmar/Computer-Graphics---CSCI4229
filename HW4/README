I have the orthogonal, perspective, and first person implementations.

---- HOW TO COMPILE ----
 Via the Terminal

1)make clean
2)make

then run the corresponding object file HW4_patel.o

3)./HW4_patel

Some useful key bindings:
 m             Switch the Perspective Mode (Perspective or Orthogonal or First Person)

 +/-           Controls our field of view

 Arrow Keys    Move around the scene and changing angles as you go
 W,A,S,D keys  When in first person will allow one to move around
 i/j           Increase or Decrease the Dim variable
 0             Reset overall view, will clear the view matrix
 ESC           Leave the program
